<b>Program that expands a binomial usign Pascal's triangle.</b>
 
<h1>Method</h1>
The Pascal's triangle is a number pattern, represented as a triangular array, where each number is the sum of two numbers directly above it, creating rows that are numerated from zero to inifinity, top to bottom.

<p> Each row of the Pascal's triangle represents the coeficients of an expanded binomial with degree equivalent to the row's index, in the same order.</p>

<p>Therefore, using a program, we can correlate each row to its respective binomial degree, expanding the binomial.</p>
